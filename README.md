# Overview

This is a project for building a simple lister plugin of Total Commander, converted from [LS-Plugin Guide](https://ghisler.fileburst.com/lsplugins/listplugsample.zip) since its dsw and dsp project files are no longer supported by Visual Studio 2022.

After building the project, `listplugin.dll` will be generated. To use it, for x86 platform, modify its name as `listplugin.wlx` and `listplugin.wlx64` for x64.
